Hi, My name is Paul McCormack. Thanks for visiting! I bought this domain about 4 years ago when I was working on a project using Azure Application Gateway. I found myself staring at my screen for hours trying to understand how I could get it to do what I needed, all the time muttering to myself

"how do I do that?"

"how do I make this work?"

"how do I do this cloud thing?"

***"HOW DO YOU CLOUD?"*** Wait a minute... That's a snazzy domain name! Ohh, it's available! *clicks buy* 😄

Fast forward a few years and I hadn't done anything with it other than some self hosted projects. So I have decided to turn it into a personal blog where I can share my experiences working in the cloud. Specifically Microsoft Azure.

I currently hold Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification, which you can verify [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/users/paulmccormack-9080/credentials/6f29b8a2ab4cc722) if you like.  I am fully commited to continued learning and sharing knowledge however I can.  I suppose the primary purpose of this site is to act as a source of reference for myself, but if others find it useful too then that's a bonus!


The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). One of the first original posts I will be making on here is how I went about setting this up. The tools I used are really great for building static sites quickly and so far it hasn't cost me anything other than the domain registration.  I've been uploading deployments and write up's to my GitHub account, which you can find by clicking the link below.  Over time I plan to transfer them all here and tidy up the GitHub readme files to reduce repetition.

It's a bit sparse at the moment but I will be adding more content over time.  Watch this space!
